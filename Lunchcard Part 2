#Example usage

# Create a LunchCard with an initial balance of 50 euros
card = LunchCard(50)

# Print the initial balance
print(card)  # Output: The balance is 50.0 euros

# Eat a regular lunch
card.eat_lunch()
print(card)  # Output: The balance is 47.4 euros

# Eat a special lunch
card.eat_special()
print(card)  # Output: The balance is 40.2 euros

# Try eating a regular lunch when the balance is low
card = LunchCard(4)
print(card)  # Output: The balance is 4.0 euros

# Eat a regular lunch (should succeed)
card.eat_lunch()
print(card)  # Output: The balance is 1.4 euros

# Try eating a regular lunch again (should not subtract, balance is too low)
card.eat_lunch()
print(card)  # Output: The balance is 1.4 euros
